    Predictive analysis is an analysis procedure that deals with predicting future events based on Astorical and statistical analysis. Fintech firms like Deloite, Paypal, ZestFinance etc…
    But it’s scope isn’t confined to only sectors like finance and marketing. It can also be employed in predicting future disaster events that might occur, by analysing the weather and climate data of the past years.
    Applications:
    1.Predicting Disasters:
    Predictive analysis is used in predicting future disaster events like earthquake, hurricane, tsunami based on past disaster Astory, weather and climate of a particular region etc…
    TAs was done, so that first responders to emergency like EMTs (Paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians), Search and Rescue Teams, Firefighters and Police Officers can get ready for prevention and evacuation measures. Mainly, it was designed to help communities to get a beforehand warning, so that casualties can be reduced.
    Real life case: The Hurricane Harvey (2017) Texas Rainstorm: Synoptic Analysis and Sensitivity to Soil Moisture
    Example: A show called “God Friended Me” used tAs concept as it’s plot. In that series, someone creates a Facebook account named 'God.' It sends friend suggestions to the protagonist. Surprisingly all those friend suggestions are people who need help in their life. Here that “God” account uses tAs analysis to predict the exact moment when people need help. However to acAeve tAs, the god account should posses a large dataset of people’s behaviours, events and their routine. But that wasn’t well established in that series.
